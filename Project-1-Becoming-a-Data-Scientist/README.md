# Things to Know about Becoming a Data Scientist

## Project Motivation

For this project, I analyzed 2015 - 2019 Stack Overflow developer data to better understand if data scientist is a right career for me (and other beginners like me). In particular, I was interested in the following questions:

* What does the data scientist community growth look like? What is the percentage of female data scientists?
* How are data scientists getting paid compared to developers in general?
* What are the essential technologies and skills for data scientists? 
* Are data scientsts happy with their career? 
* How many hours data scientists work per week?

## Installation

No extra besides the built-in libraries from Anaconda needed to run this project:

* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* os
* matplotlib

## File Descriptions

* data: Folder contains data files of StackOverflow developer survey data, following name conventions of "YYYY.csv"
* Project1-Becoming-a-Data-Scientist.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook used for the main analytics

## Results

* In general, there is a continous increase in data scientist community, and the ratio of female data scientists is higher than that of all developers
* Data scientists are paid better than developers in average
* To become a data scientist, we need to be familiar with Python (top 1 language), MySQL(top 1 database), Linux (top 1 platform), jQuery (top 1 webframe)
* Most data scientists are happy with their career 
* Most data scientists work less than 50 hours per week
