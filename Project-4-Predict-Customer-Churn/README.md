## Project Motivation
This project serves as an exploration of how to make a churn-prediction model using Spark, with the following steps included:

- explore and manipulate our dataset
- engineer relevant features for our problem
- split data into train and test sets by sampling churn
- build binary classifier models with Sparkâ€™s DataFrame-based ML

## Dependencies
- python==3.7.3
- pyspark==2.4.4
- spark-stratifier==0.1.5
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyterlab
